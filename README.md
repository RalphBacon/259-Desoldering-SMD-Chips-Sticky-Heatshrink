## 1. Introduction
Desoldering chips (and, indeed, anything with lots of pins) can be a challenge if you want the PCB to survive along with the device you're desoldering.

Here I show you a brand name desoldering alloy that is perfect for the job!

And also how to join two low-voltage wires for (outdoor) use to make them strong and waterproof (mine's going into my goldfish pond!) using a special heat shrink that is not only strong but waterproof too.

Louis Rossmann video (with Steve Burke from GamersNexus ) showing that you can never use too much flux when soldering PCBs, so funny
