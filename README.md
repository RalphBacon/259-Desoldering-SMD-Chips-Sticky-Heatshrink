## 1. Introduction
Desoldering chips (and, indeed, anything with lots of pins) can be a challenge if you want the PCB to survive along with the device you're desoldering.

Here I show you a brand name desoldering alloy that is perfect for the job!

And also how to join two wires for (outdoor) use to make them strong and waterproof (mine's going into my goldfish pond!) using a special heat shrink that is not only strong but waterproof too.

Louis Rossmann video (with Steve Burke from GamersNexus ) showing that you can never use too much flux when soldering PCBs, so funny
